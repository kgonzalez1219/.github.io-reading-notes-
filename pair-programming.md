# JavaScript and Jquery

**293-301** -

Jquery is a javascript file that lets you find elements using css style selectors. 
Jquery performs different Javascript tasks quickly and consistently. 
It makes selecting elements easier. 

The function jQuery lets you find one or more elements on a page & hold references of those elements. It has sone parameter, which is the selector.
It can be used to manipulate the DOM.

Once you've selected the elements you want there are several methods you can use to effect change on them, each of which has its own parameters that provide details on how the elements should be updated. 

At the end of the day, while it does the same things JavaScript does, it makes it much simpler.

Also, it's cross browser compatible.

### Matched Sets

When one or more elements is selected a jQuery object is returned. This is called a matched set, or jQuery selection. 
The object contains references to each element that is selected. Each element is assigned an index number .

### Getting and setting data

Some methods retrieve and update info. If there are multiple references within the jQuery selection, any attempt to retirieve info will only work on the first element. To get info from all elemetns, you woult use the each() method. 

If pdating info, the method will update all the elements. 

jQuery can be added from a cdn & hav9ng the script tag in the head of a document.
